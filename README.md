## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why did I use MVVM?
The reason is that MVVM is one of the most used architectures in companies today, it makes unit testing much easier, because the purpose of MVVM is that the code is broken up into classes with a small number of well defined responsibilities. Following up SOLID principals and having a clean, maintainable and testable code.

#### How to run the project?
Clone or Download the project and open in Xcode.

#### Why not using Storyboards/Xibs?
There are several reasons why I prefer to create my views programmatically, but the main reason is that it improves the build time of the app. This is topic that many huge companies are concerned.
